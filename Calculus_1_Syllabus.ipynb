        "Sophia’s Calculus I course helps you build mastery of the fundamental concepts of calculus. In this course, you will start by reviewing precalculus topics and then gain experience with limits and continuity, interpretations and applications of derivatives, and techniques of integration. You will also have the opportunity to demonstrate the application of these calculus topics with real-world situations. Prior completion of PreCalculus is recommended.\n",
